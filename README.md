# Braille-System

# Project Background
In our study, we design and put into practice a tool that can draw shapes and text for a newly constructed 3D printer that enables blind people to feel and touch the output.
From a drop-down list, users can choose from a variety of standard formats, or they can choose text and have it converted to Braille. The client's access to this tool is intended to be through HTTP.The required dot size is determined based on the parameters for the chosen standard shape (height, width, and radius) as well as the parameters for the Braille text. In addition, height and radius are used to determine the liquid's volume. Once the client application receives the image and Braille Name, it displays both.

# Project Objectives
The main goal of this project is to create and put into use a tool that can print out different shapes and types of text so that blind people can touch and feel the results.
Designing and implementing the tool for this service should adhere to best practices and design patterns. The client and service communicate with one another using HTTP. It is implemented using.NET.This project's overarching goal is to give blind people a new mode of interaction with their environment.
Our project's business goals include: 
• Offering a fresh perspective on visual information.
• enhancing the business's reputation.
• Boost revenue by offering the tool for sale.
• Acquiring knowledge for the development of assistive technologies.
